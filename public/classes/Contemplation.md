In book X of the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle describes the contemplative life as the life which is the most fulfilling and consequently the happiest. Contemplation, Aristotle goes on, is the only activity that brings about happiness. There are numerous questions that are raised by Aristotleâ€™s description. What do we mean, precisely, by contemplation? How does it relate to other human activities? What does a contemplative life consist in? In this course we will address some of these questions as they present themselves in Aristotle, Aquinas, and Josef Pieper. We will also discuss some interpretative issues relating to these thinkers, and compare their overall approach in answering the question of what makes a life the best possible life.
