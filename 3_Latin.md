The CSC Latin Reading Group is a group of students and faculty who develop, exercise, and enjoy their Latin skills in our weekly meetings. In the Fall 2018 semester, we are reading the <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/egeria.html" target="_blank">*Itinerarium Egeriae*</a>, a travel diary of a 4th-century Spanish pilgrim woman traveling to the Holy Land. It is a fascinating text with picturesque descriptions of scenery.

There is quite a lot of (both good and bad) literature concerning Egeria's travels; a good starting point is <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Egeria_s_Travels.html?id=451fAAAAMAAJ&source=kp_book_description" target="_blank">John Wilkinson, ed., *Egeria's Travels* (S.P.C.K, 1971; reprint Liverpool, 1999)</a>. There is also some useful information on the now quite outdated website of the <a href="http://www.egeriaproject.net/main.aspx" target="_blank">Egeria project</a>, while a detailed map of Egeria's itinerary, based on the *Itinerarium*, is available
<a href="http://worldmap.harvard.edu/maps/4249" target="_blank">here</a>.

Everyone is welcome to the group; proficiency in Latin is not required. <a href="http://logeion.uchicago.edu/index.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is a great Latin dictionary to make things easier.
