The CSC Latin Reading Group is a group of students and faculty who develop, exercise, and enjoy their Latin skills at our weekly meetings. In the Spring 2019 semester, we are reading some of <a href="https://www.augustinus.it/latino/commento_lsg/index2.htm" target="_blank"> Augustine's sermons</a>.

In earlier semesters we were working on the <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/egeria.html" target="_blank">*Itinerarium Egeriae*</a>, the travel diary of a 4th-century Spanish pilgrim woman traveling to the Holy Land.

Everyone is welcome to the group; proficiency in Latin is not required. <a href="http://logeion.uchicago.edu/index.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is a great Latin dictionary to make things a bit easier.
