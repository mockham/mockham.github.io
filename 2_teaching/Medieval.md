In this course, we look at philosophy from around the 4th to the 14th centuries. Although this is a broad time-period that resists general claims about its philosophical tendencies, most auhors we will consider were primarily concerned with the question how to fit Christianity into a broadly speaking Aristotelian, scientific world-view (or on the converse, how to fit a scientific world-view into a broadly speaking theological framework). Topics of discussion will include, among others, questions concerning faith and reason, knowledge and skepticism, causation, and human nature. Representative figures include Augustine, Boethius, Anselm, Averroes, Siger of Brabant, Aquinas, Giles of Rome, Henry of Ghent, Duns Scotus, Ockham, Nicholas of Autrecourt, and John Buridan.
