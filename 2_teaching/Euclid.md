Plato inscribed above the portal to his Academy the following words: "Let no one ignorant of geometry enter here." Following this tradition, Thomas Aquinas insists that a study of mathematics must precede the study of natural philosophy and metaphysics. Thus, this  course examines Euclid's *Elements* both as a fine example of a system of geometry (with definitions, postulates, propositions, and proofs), and as an instance of Greek thought taken more broadly. Topics include triangles, circles, abstract proportions, geomet- ric similarity, number theory, the notion of incommensurability, and solid geometry.
