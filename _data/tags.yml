  description: >
    The Fordham Philosophy Latin Reading Group is a group of students and faculty whose primary interest is medieval philosophy (although classicists are by no means excluded), and who already have at least some working knowledge of Latin. We usually meet once a week for an hour or so and try to read texts that are somehow connected to the research interests of some of the participants and that are not available in English translation. Thus, the groupâ€™s aim is both linguistic and philosophical: it gives both a good practice of medieval Latin and an occasion to reflect on some problems and perhaps lesser known arguments in medieval philosophy. For more information, or if you wish to attend, please contact [me](mailto:ztoth@fordham.edu) or [Giorgio Pini](mailto:pini@fordham.edu).
