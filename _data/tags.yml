    What do we mean precisely when we say that the fire is cracking in the fireplace *because* I lit it? Or what is happening when the fire *ignites* the newspaper I threw in it? Is this merely a way of everyday talking, to be abandoned after some philosophical reflection, or are there really things acting on each other? Would our answer be different if there were some higher agent (God) who is responsible for every being at every moment of their existence? In the last few decades' emerging neo-Aristotelian metaphysics, some of these questions have received revived attention --- but surprisingly, these treatments leave  the richest tradition devoted to them unmentioned. Perhaps this is due to the fact that there is no comprehensive study on medieval theories of causation and divine concurrence, nor on their heritage in early modern philosophy. With my research on medieval accounts of causation and divine concurrence I aim to fill this gap. My underlying conviction is that these medieval accounts are both intrinsically interesting, as well as enable us to learn a great deal about metaphysics, philosophy of religion, and some problems of early modern philosophy and science.

    The Fordham Philosophy Latin Reading Group is a group of students and faculty whose primary interest is medieval philosophy (although classicists are by no means excluded), and who already have at least some working knowledge of Latin. We usually meet once a week for an hour or so and try to read texts that are somehow connected to the research interests of some of the participants and that are not available in English translation. Thus, the groupâ€™s aim is both linguistic and philosophical: it gives both a good practice of medieval Latin and an occasion to reflect on some problems and perhaps lesser known arguments in medieval philosophy. For more information, or if you wish to attend, please contact [me](mailto:ztoth@fordham.edu) or [Giorgio Pini](mailto:pini@fordham.edu).
