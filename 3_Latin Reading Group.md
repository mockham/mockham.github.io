The CSC Latin Reading Group is a group of students and faculty who develop, exercise, and enjoy their Latin skills in our weekly meetings. In the Fall 2018 semester, we are reading the <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/egeria.html">*Itinerarium Egeriae*</a>, a travel diary of a 4th-century Spanish woman pilgrim on the Holy Land. It is an fascinating text with picturesque descriptions of scenery.

Everyone is welcome; proficiency in Latin is not required.
