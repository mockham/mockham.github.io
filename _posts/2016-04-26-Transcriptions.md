Some manuscript and early print transcriptions I have been working on recently. These are drafts, not proper editions, and may contain (a lot of) grammatical errors as well as typos. As a general principle, I kept as close to the original as I could, although punctuation has been added throughout.

<ul>
<li><h4><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/texts/Paludinus/">Peter of Palude: <i>In II Sent.</i>, d.1, q.4</a></h4> </li> ("Whether God is immediately active in every operation of nature")
<li> <h4><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/texts/Ailly/">Peter of Ailly: <i>In IV Sent. </i></a> </h4></li> (questions on causation)
</ul>
