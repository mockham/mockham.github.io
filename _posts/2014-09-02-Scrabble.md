<img align="right" src="/public/img/scrabble.jpg" width="250"> We have started the department's first ever Latin Scrabble Club! We play once a month or so (schedule is flexible, depending on the participants), and yes, we do have a Latin Scrabble board and letters (with way to few *Q*'s). Medieval spelling is allowed.
