I have been working on a critical edition of Peter of Palude's *Sentences* commentary, book II, d.1, q.4. Peter was a Dominican theologian at the turn of the thirteenth- and fourteenth centuries, working primarily in Paris, and participating in the investigation against his confriar, Durand of St.-Pourcain. This question in his commentary concerns whether God is immediately active in every operation of nature, and is a response to Durand's answer for the negative.
