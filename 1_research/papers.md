### Published Papers


<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/1_research/Toth2019b_0.pdf">“Ockham on Divine Concurrence,”</a> <i>Saint Anselm Journal</i> 15 (2019): 81–105.
<br>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px"><small>The focus of this paper is Ockham’s stance on the question of divine concurrence—the question whether God is causally active in the causal happenings of the created world, and if so, what God’s causal activity amounts to and what place that leaves for created causes. After discussing some preliminaries, I turn to presenting what I take to be Ockham’s account. As I show, Ockham, at least in this issue, is rather conservative: he agrees with the majority of medieval thinkers (including Aquinas, Giles of Rome, Duns Scotus, and others) that both God and created agents are causally active in the causal happenings of the world. Then I turn to some texts that may suggest otherwise; I argue that reading Ockham as either an occasionalist or a mere conservationist based on these texts originates from a misunderstanding of his main concern. I conclude with raising and briefly addressing some systematic worries regarding Ockham’s account of concurrence.</small></p>

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/1_research/Toth2016a_0.pdf">“Peter of Palude on Divine Concurrence: An Edition of His In Sent. II, d.1, q.4,”</a> <i>Recherches de Théologie et Philosophie Médiévales</i> 83 (2016): 49–92.
<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px"><small>The present text contains a critical edition of Peter of Palude’s question of divine concurrence, found in his Sentences commentary, book II, d. 1, q. 4. the question concerns whether God is immediately active in every action of a creature, and if yes, how we should understand this divine concurrence. Peter, just as elsewhere in his commentary, considers at length the opinions of other thinkers — especially those of Giles of Rome, Durand of St.-Pourçain, and Thomas Aquinas — and develops his own answer as a response to theirs. Thus, while Giles maintained that God acts uniformly in every instance of natural causation just as the sun acts uniformly by giving the same light to everything, Peter (following Durand) argues that this is incompatible with the divine creation of multiple things. Second, while Durand maintained that God is only mediately active in the actions of creatures, Peter rejects this opinion because it cannot account for miracles contra naturam (such as the three young men in Nebuchadnezzar’s fire), and because he thinks that God’s immediate action follows from his immediate conservation of creatures. Third, Peter presents Aquinas’s position in detail, and defends it against Durand’s objections; according to this position, God immediately conserves and concurs with every creature, with an action that is numerically distinct from that of the secondary agent. Although as a result of his extensive borrowing, Peter’s text might not be regarded as immensely original, it provides an interesting case study of the Dominican reaction against Durand in the early 1300’s.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px"><small>Descartes Optikája egyike ama ritka helynek, ahol a szerző explicit módon tárgyalja és kritizálja a középkori látásmagyarázatokat.

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/1_research/Toth2011aa_0.pdf">“Scientific Method in John Buridan,”</a> <i>Annual of Medieval Studies at CEU</i> 17, ed. Alice Choyke and Daniel Ziemann (Budapest: CEU Press, 2011), 23–40.
<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px"><small>There is little point to enumerate all the diverse opinions that still mark the study of medieval natural philosophy, and especially its methodology. It is enough to point out that while some authors reproach medieval science for its over-rationality, others argue that modern science emerged precisely because of the refutation of over-empiricism that had characterized its medieval antecedent. The present paper picks out only one specific aspect of this cluster of problems, together with one specific author, that is, the meaning and role of ‘experiment’ in the treatise on vacuum in the Physics commentary of John Buridan. While the experimental method is often regarded as a main characteristic of modern science distinguishing it from its predecessors, John Buridan (ca. 1300—1358) was undoubtedly the most influential natural philosopher in fourteenth-century Paris. Thus, examining this crucial concept in the natural philosophy of Buridan might help to situate it in the more general medieval framework; beside this, this examination will also have some consequences regarding the much-debated issue of the relationship between Buridan’s methodological practice and theory. In the first section I present an overview and a possible categorization of Buridan’s experiments, which shows that these experiments were in certain respects remarkably different from those that are regarded as experiments today. In the second section I examine how these experiments relate to Buridan’s theory of science, and argue that his methodological practice is strongly dependent on his methodological theory.</small></p>

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/1_research/Toth2010a_0.pdf">“Aquinas and Buridan on the Possibility of Scientific Knowledge,”</a> In <i>Thomas Aquinas and Thomism Today</i>, ed. Bulcsú K. Hoppál (Budapest: L’Harmattan, 2010), 163–174.
<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px"><small>This paper examines a specific but basic problem of Aristotelian natural philosophy which arises if we consider the following three propositions, stated as necessary requirements towards knowledge in the proper sense (quoted now from Aristotle):
(1) The object of knowledge is of necessity and of the universal.
(2) The soul never thinks without an image.
(3) We understand something when we know its causes.
In the following, I deal only with the first two, that is, with the possible reconciliation of the empiricist and the universalistic claim. After outlining the solution of Thomas Aquinas and some criticism of it in the 14th century, I shall call attention to John Buridan, who – despite his apparent Nominalism –, in certain respects, turns out to be surprisingly Thomistic.</small></p>


### Drafts, Talks, Work in progress

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/1_research/Toth2019a_0.pdf">"Perfect Subjects, Shields, and Retractions: Three Models of Impassibility."
<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px"><small>According to theological consensus at least from the thirteenth century, at the End of Times our body will be resurrected and reunited with our soul. The resurrected body, although numerically identical to our present one, will be quite different: it will possess clarity, agility, subtility, and the inability to suffer. It is the last of these characteristics that will be of most concern in the present paper. There are two reasons why impassibility presents a problem in the medieval framework. The first has to do with how to characterize impassibility more precisely; the second arises because at first it may seem that impassiblity is not metaphysically possible at all. I am going to look at three attempts to tackle these problems: those of Aquinas, Durand of St.-Pourçain, and Peter of Palude. As I hope to show, looking at how causal powers work on the New Earth may shed some light on how medieval thinkers thought they worked on the present one.</small></p>
