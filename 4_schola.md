The St. Gregory Schola is a small group of volunteer singers at <a href="https://stgregorysmaryville.org" target="_blank">St. Gregory's Parish</a> in Maryville. We provide music for the  Sunday 5 p.m. mass about once a month. Our repertoire includes well-known hymns, Gregorian chants, as well as some polyphony from the Renaissance to the present.
