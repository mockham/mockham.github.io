I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in philosophy at the University of Virginia. Before coming to Charlottesville, I taught philosophy and mathematics at Conception Seminary College in Missouri.
I received my PhD in 2017 from <a href = "http://www.fordham.edu" target="_blank">Fordham University</a>.

<br>
<br>

My main interest is later medieval philosophy, especially questions connected to metaphysics, philosophy of religion, and epistemology. I am also interested in the history of science, mainly in the connection between late medieval and early modern scientific practice and theory. My research focuses primarily on issues connected to causation, and some medieval questions related to secondary causation and divine concurrence.
<br>
<br>

When I am not doing philosophy, I enjoy hiking, woodworking, and listening to and playing 14--18th-century music.
