I am an Assistant Professor of philosophy at <a href = "http://www.conception.edu" target="_blank">Conception Seminary College</a>, which I joined in the fall of 2017.
I received my PhD in the same year from <a href = "http://www.fordham.edu" target="_blank">Fordham University</a>, in New York.

<br>
<br>

My main interest is later medieval philosophy, especially questions connected to metaphysics, philosophy of religion, and epistemology. I am also interested in the history of science, mainly in the connection between late medieval and early modern scientific practice and theory. My dissertation was on later medieval problems of secondary causality and divine concurrence (broadly between Aquinas and Gabriel Biel; <a href ="http://zitavtoth.com/5_archive/Diss/">see the abstract</a>).
<br>
<br>

When I am not doing philosophy, I enjoy hiking, woodworking, listening to and playing 14--18th-century music, and directing the <a href="http://zitavtoth.com/4_schola/">St. Gregory Schola</a>.<br><br>
